# Docapi 

This project aims to provide a collaborative tool for documenting RESTful APIs. It's still being work in progress but feel free to contribute or folk it if you like.

### Tech

Docapi uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Angular] - One framework. Mobile & desktop
* [Sails] - The most popular MVC framework for Node.js
* [RxJS] - The ReactiveX library for JavaScript
* [Immutable] - Immutable collections for JavaScript
* [AngularMaterial] - Material Design components for Angular apps
* [MongoDB] - The leading document database
* [Redis] - An in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Docker] - Docker is the worldâ€™s leading software containerization platform

And of course Docapi itself is open source with a [public repository][docapi]
 on GitHub.
